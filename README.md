# final_project_big_data

Stock Exchange Data Analysis using Big Data Tools
This project showcases a complete data pipeline for analyzing stock exchange data using a Medallion Architecture approach (Bronze → Silver → Gold). It leverages Apache Spark for processing, Cassandra for storage, and Jupyter for exploration and visualization.

**⚙️ Tech Stack**
Apache Spark – Distributed data processing
Apache Cassandra – NoSQL database for structured storage
Jupyter Notebook – Data transformation and visualization
Poetry – Python dependency management

**📊 Architecture**
Bronze Layer: Raw ingestion from exchange_data.csv
Silver Layer: Cleaned and transformed data
Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytical-ready insights stored in Cassandra

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.8+
Apache Spark
Apache Cassandra running locally or via secure bundle
Poetry installed (pip install poetry)

**Setup**
Clone the repository: https://github.com/Revanth0017/final_project_big_data.git

**🗄️ Database Connection**
Use secure-connect-cassandradb.zip and cassandradb-token.json to authenticate and connect to your Cassandra instance.

**📌 Notes**
The .ruff_cache/ is used for linting and code formatting.
All transformations and logic are implemented in the notebook using PySpark.
